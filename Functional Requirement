## 3. Functional Requirements

### FR-01: Parking Search
- The system shall allow users to enter a location or enable geolocation.
- The system shall fetch nearby parking facilities using Google Maps Places API.
- The system shall return a list of parking options sorted by proximity.

### FR-02: Availability Estimation
- The system shall simulate real-time parking availability using zone/time rules.
- The system shall show estimated availability using color-coded indicators (e.g., green, yellow, red).
- The system shall update simulated availability data every 60 seconds.

### FR-03: EV Charging Filter
- The system shall allow users to apply a filter to show only EV-compatible parking locations.
- The system shall identify EV-compatible locations using metadata from Places API or OpenStreetMap.

### FR-04: Navigation Integration
- The system shall provide routing from user location to selected parking using Google Directions API.
- The system shall include estimated travel time and distance.

### FR-05: Interactive Map Display
- The system shall display search results on a map interface.
- The system shall allow users to click on markers to view parking details.
- The map shall auto-zoom to fit search results.

### FR-06: UI Requirements
- The system shall provide a responsive web interface accessible via desktop and mobile.
- The interface shall include:
  - Search input
  - Filter options (EV charger, zone)
  - Map view
  - Details panel for selected parking
